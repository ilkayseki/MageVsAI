https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wolffun.herostrike&hl=en
2) Map:
● A map with very simple objects (boxes without texture & texture, etc.). No special design is required.
3) Characters:
● Characters will have 3 types of animations, idle, move and attack.
● Characters will throw a stone, etc. to attack.
● Stone will do random damage in a certain range. The health of the characters will be enough for multiple stone hits.
4) Gameplay:
● Players of two teams consisting of 1 person each will start the game in different parts of the map and their aim will be to kill each other 10 times.
● The player who reaches 10 kill points will win the game.
● When players die, they will respawn in a different part of the map.
5) Artificial intelligence:
● After the opponent spawns, it will move towards us and after a certain distance, it will move to the right and left a certain distance and stop in between and try to throw stones at us.
● Every stone he throws will not move towards us, but will move forward with a certain margin of error.
6) Visual content & assets:
● You can make the assets yourself or buy them from outside, the quality is not so important. Our expectation from you is to reflect your experience in shader and game feeling as much as you can in this project.
